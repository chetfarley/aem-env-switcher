  <h1>Privacy Policy for AEM Environment Switcher</h1>

  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2025</p>

  <p>
    The AEM Environment Switcher Chrome extension (“the extension”) is designed solely 
    to help users quickly switch between configured Adobe Experience Manager 
    environment URLs. Your privacy is important, and this policy explains what 
    information is — and is not — collected.
  </p>

  <h2>Information the Extension Collects</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does <strong>not collect, transmit, store, or share</strong> any 
    personal information, browsing data, or user-generated content.
  </p>

  <p>The only data used by the extension is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Environment configuration settings</strong> (the AEM author and 
      publish URLs you enter yourself).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These settings are stored locally in your browser's 
    <strong>chrome.storage.sync</strong> area.  
    <strong>They never leave your browser</strong> and are not transmitted to any 
    server or external service.
  </p>

  <h2>No Personal Data Collected</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does <strong>not</strong> collect or process:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Names or email addresses</li>
    <li>Location or IP addresses</li>
    <li>Authentication information or passwords</li>
    <li>Financial or payment data</li>
    <li>Health information</li>
    <li>Browsing history</li>
    <li>User activity (mouse, clicks, keystrokes, etc.)</li>
    <li>Website content</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>No Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does <strong>not</strong> sell, share, or transfer any data 
    (including configuration settings) to any third party.
  </p>

  <h2>No Remote Code</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does <strong>not</strong> load or execute remote code of any kind.  
    All JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files are packaged directly within the extension.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The extension uses a small set of browser permissions strictly required for its 
    single purpose:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>tabs</strong> – to read the current tab's URL and open a switched URL in a new tab.</li>
    <li><strong>storage</strong> – to store your AEM environment settings locally.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The extension does <strong>not</strong> request access to any other data.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does not connect to or interact with any third-party servers or APIs.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    The privacy policy may be updated in the future. If updated, the revision date at 
    the top of the page will be changed.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>

    If you have questions about this policy, you may contact the developer at:<br/>
